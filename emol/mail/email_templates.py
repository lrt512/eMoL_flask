PRIVACY_POLICY_EMAIL = '''Greetings!

Congratulations on your authorization!

Now, let's get your authorization card in order...

In late 2016, Ealdormere moved to a fully-online card management system, the
Electronic Minister of the Lists, or eMoL.

However, by Canadian law, before we finalize you in the eMoL database you must
be given the option to opt-out and the ability to view and accept our privacy
policy before you make that decision. At the end of this email, you'll find a
link that will take you to the eMoL privacy policy. Give it a read and then
accept or decline it.

It's completely up to you whether you accept or decline. If you don't want
your information stored online by us, that's fine, just decline the privacy
policy. This is what happens in either case:

If You Accept
=============
We'll finalize your entry in the eMoL database and note that you accepted the
privacy policy. You will be able to:
- View your authorization card online
- Manage your information online
- Manage any new authorizations you get online
- Receive email notification when your card is getting close to expiry
- Receive email notification when your waiver on file is getting close to expiry

If You Decline
==============
We'll delete all trace of you from the eMoL database
- The MoL will track your authorizations and information manually, offline
- You will be mailed an authorization card
- When your card expires, you will have to either find the MoL in person, or
  mail them your card to be re-stamped with a new expiry date
- The MoL will track any new authorizations you get manually
- You won't get any automatic reminders about card expiry
- The MoL will still email you manually about waiver expiry

This link will take you to the privacy policy page.

{privacy_policy_url}

Please read the policy
carefully. It explains what information we store, how we protect it, and how
we use it. As above, accept or decline it and we'll go from there!

The link will be usable for one week from the date of this email, after which
it will expire and a new one must be requested.
